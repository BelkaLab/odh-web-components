# odh-web-components
Common repository for all web-components created in line with the opendatahub project.

All additons and constribution need to made through pull requests. Only opendatahub-core member will have write permissions for this repositories and will be the once to review contributions and check if guidelines are being followed.

## Guidelines

1. Fork the repository  and send your contributions through pull-requests. Don't work on the master branch, but on a **feature branch**. As soon as you have something that can be shown/tested **open a pull-request** to our **development** branch. You will see if it is compliant through our CI, which will tell you on the commit with a checkmark if it passed or not. If it's not passing try to rebase your changes using the development branch of our repository. As long as we don't accept your pull-request, you can commit to your feature branch and they will automatically flow into the pull-request.
2. Work in one single root-folder which should follow this naming convention:`odh-[topic]-webcomponent`
